Part 1: Gauss Newton Method

-Q,R Householder: change a = np.array to the test case and execute the code
-Q,R Givens: change c = np.array to the test case and execute the code

-Rational Method: prompts for a list of ordered pairs in the format [(1,2), (3,4), ...(xn, yn)], then initial guess, then number of iterations
-Logarithmic Method: prompts for a list of ordered pairs in the format [(1,2), (3,4), ...(xn, yn)], then initial guess, then number of iterations
-Quadratic Method: prompts for a list of ordered pairs in the format [(1,2), (3,4), ...(xn, yn)], then initial guess, then number of iterations
-Exponential Method: prompts for a list of ordered pairs in the format [(1,2), (3,4), ...(xn, yn)], then initial guess, then number of iterations

Part 2: Power Method

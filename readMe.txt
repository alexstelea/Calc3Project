Part 1: Gauss Newton Method

-Q,R Householder: change a = np.array to the test case and execute the code
-Q,R Givens: change c = np.array to the test case and execute the code

-Rational Method: prompts for a list of ordered pairs in the format [(1,2), (3,4), ...(xn, yn)], then initial guess, then number of iterations
-Logarithmic Method: prompts for a list of ordered pairs in the format [(1,2), (3,4), ...(xn, yn)], then initial guess, then number of iterations
-Quadratic Method: prompts for a list of ordered pairs in the format [(1,2), (3,4), ...(xn, yn)], then initial guess, then number of iterations
-Exponential Method: prompts for a list of ordered pairs in the format [(1,2), (3,4), ...(xn, yn)], then initial guess, then number of iterations

Part 2: Power Method

Run the code to execute the scatter plot

Part 3: Animation 2D (Extra Credit Option)

Open the mp4 file and watch video or run animation_2d.py
(not 120 frames as it continuously loops)
